<b>push_swap</b>

This project will make you sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using
the lowest possible number of actions. To succeed youâ€™ll have to manipulate various
types of algorithms and choose the most appropriate solution (out of many) for an
optimized data sorting.

The goal is to sort in ascending order numbers into stack a. To do so you have the
following operations at your disposal:
sa (swap a): Swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack a.
sb (swap b): Swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack b.
ss : sa and sb at the same time.
pa (push a): Take the first element at the top of b and put it at the top of a.
pb (push b): Take the first element at the top of a and put it at the top of b.
ra (rotate a): Shift up all elements of stack a by 1. The first element becomes the last one.
rb (rotate b): Shift up all elements of stack b by 1.The first element becomes the last one.
rr : ra and rb at the same time.
rra (reverse rotate a): Shift down all elements of stack a by 1. The last element becomes the first one.
rrb (reverse rotate b): Shift down all elements of stack b by 1.  The last element becomes the first one.
rrr : rra and rrb at the same time.
